# Deep Learning with Python

This repository contains my implementations and notes from the book  
**[Deep Learning with Python (1st Edition)](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python)** by François Chollet.  

The material is split into 4 notebooks, following the book’s structure.  
They include examples, experiments, and my personal comments while working through the chapters.
